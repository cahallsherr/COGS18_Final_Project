This project is a game where you design and chat with a character. First you must design a bear character; you can choose from a Polar Bear, Black Bear, or Brown Bear. You can also choose the outfit of the character and its personality. The possible outfit choices are a star shirt, a heart shirt, or a plain shirt. The possible personalities are sweet, sassy, and bro. After designing, you are able to chat with your character!

**Design Options:**
   -  *Shirt:* star, heart, none
   - *Bear type:* polar, brown, black
   -  *Personality:* sweet, sassy, bro

To design your character, enter the following and replace each category with your desired design option and name with the name of your choice:

    name = MyCharacter('name', 'bear type', 'personality', 'outfit')

After this, you can meet your character! Type: 

    name.show_character() 
    
    and
    
    name.introduction()

To chat with your character, type:

    character_chat(name)
    

The goal of this project was to deisgn a simple but entertaining game. I played many character designing/dress up games as a kid, so I thought it would be fun to make something interactive that would satisfy my nostalgia. 

**You must have the images folder in order for this to function properly**
